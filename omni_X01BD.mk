# components for this device.

# As much as possible, those components should be built unconditionally,
# with device-specific names to avoid collisions, to avoid device-specific
# bitrot and build breakages. Building a component unconditionally does
# *not* include it on all devices, so it is safe even with hardware-specific
# components.
